               <p>My name is Alissandra Young and I have a passion for planning all sorts of events, especially weddings. As a Wausau native, I've loved living here since I can remember and am thrilled to grow a business in my hometown. I graduated from Fox Valley Technical College in May of 2016 with a degree in Meeting & Event Management and was certified as an event planner during my time in school.</p>
               <p>I got my start in the events industry during high school in 2012 when I was one of the only people on the prom committee willing to take on extra planning to ensure the event's success, such as hiring a DJ and taking the time to decorate the entire day before. Back in 2011 my mom and I had started running a side photography business called Young Photography, and until October of 2015 I had always been a photographer or florist for events - never a planner. Throughout the years I did begin to plan aspects of these special days and soon realized that I wanted to transcend my role as just a vendor to have a larger part in special events.</p>
               <p>In January of 2015, I packed up my bags at the University of Wisconsin-Oshkosh and transfered to Fox Valley Technical College to pursue my true passion of event management. I graduated a year later, and the rest is history. I have worked many events, including 15+ weddings and engagements, tea parties, formal dances, and even corporate luncheons. My commitment and experiences led to winning an award for my tabletop design at the 2016 Midwest Foodservice Expo. Though I'm well-rounded in the variety of events I handle, weddings are my true passion.</p>
               <p>Check out some of our event planning stories below, and I'm always here to answer anything that you may need! Happy planning; I can't wait to see how I can help fit your event needs!</p>

                   <h3>Prom & Senior Ball</h3>
                       <p>When I was in high school, I was one of the only ones who gave events the time and dedication that they needed. Needless to say, I fell in love with them. Ever since then, I've loved planning any type of event that I could.</p>
                       <p>I planned our prom, including the color scheme, decorations, set-up, booking the DJ, securing the venue site and working with my teachers to get other materials, as well as a timeline of events ready.</p>
                       <p>I also worked on my Senior Ball, planning the event and how it would be set up, creating a timeline, booking the DJ, picking the food to be served, booking a photobooth, as well as decorating the day before and tearing down the night of, almost completely by myself.</p>

                   <h3>Floral Design</h3>
                       <p>Around the time that I realized that I loved events, I also loved the floral world. I was getting ready for a dance and was looking at the expensive prices of formal dance flowers. It was then that I decided to take up a little business and make these with artificial flowers for those at my high school. 
                       <p>During the next three years, I made over 70 couple's prom flowers.</p> 
                       <p>In 2014, I started experimenting with real flowers and produced my first set of real formal dance flowers.</p> 
                       <p>Now, I have been booked doing floral arrangements for 2 weddings in 2016, and it is a passion that I look at pursuing more in the future...</p>

                   <h3>Young Photography</h3>
                       <p>In 2011, my mother got a camera for Christmas. She was obsessed and we then decided to further research and learn about the field. Once we were ready, we decided to take on our own "mini" business.</p>
                       <p>Last summer we had two weddings, this summer we have over seven. We have also done five engagement sessions in 2015, four newborn sessions, as well as many senior sessions and family shoots.</p>
                       <p>It's not a full-time thing, but it is a cool way for my mom and I to take some time and bond over a passion that we both love and deeply enjoy.</p>

               <p>In March of 2016, we competed in the table top design competition at the Midwest FoodService Expo in Milwaukee. There were 12 total tables in numerous categories.</p>
               <p>Our table, called "Fall In Love", warmly incorporated autumn colors and themes. We had rust colored sashes and napkins, a burlap table runner, log slab centerpieces, fall floral arrangements, and pinecone place card holders.</p>
               <p>Thanks to the multitude of social media votes that we earned, we ended up winning the competition's social choice category!</p>

                   <p>"Thanks Ali!! We got married on April 3. It was a very small wedding that we planned as a beach themed wedding. Ali decorated our tables in the garage that had a beach theme feel to it. It was awesome. She also made me beach theme center pieces for the tables. Everything she did was reasonable and to everyones liking. She also made flowers for the girls. If you are looking for help on your next party give Ali a call! She has great ideas and will work with you!!!"</p>
